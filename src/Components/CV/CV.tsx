                            and some social networking features using React with TypeScript and SPFx and continuous delivery. I was able
                            to learn React in a very limited time and build UI inensive applications scalable on mobile, tablet and desktop
                            devices. The system is used by thousands of users every day.

                            Instrumental role in designing and implementing software solutions for delivering and presenting market research
                            data. My responsibilities included designing and implementing features and modules for multiple client facing
                            reporting and content management systems, a workflow system, a central authorisation solution and an internal
                            project management system. I gained major experience in designing and developing cloud (Azure) based software
                            solutions.

                        <h4>Highlighted responsibilities and achievements:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Product owner of a client facing content management and reporting system. I was responsible for
                            managing feature and change requests for a system used for both managing sample files by clients and
                            dynamically presenting research results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Product owner of a sample processing workflow system. I was responsible for implementing optimisations
                            and new features to a system which was processing sample files at a high level of parallelism. Challenges
                            included optimising the performance of running multiple thousand Azure Functions in parallel by writing
                            optimal C# code and optimising database operations using CosmosDB and MS SQL.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Full software redesign of an internal project management system. The project resulted in significant
                            performance imprevement for users, making them use the system more often which resulted in more up
                            to date data regarding projects and field work. We also managed to improve code quality, maintainability
                            and extendability by a large margin, due to designing a more consistent API, replacing existing design
                            patterns with ones that better fit the purpose, removing/simplifying ones whiches added value at the cost
                            of complexity was questionable and by making sure there is a clear separation of architecture layers.
